# Details:
These are "DOMAIN-ONLY" **converted** versions of various popular original filter / blocking lists.
They have been modified from their original versions by scripts at: https://github.com/justdomains/ci

The scripts output **only** the full-domain-blocking entries from the original lists, while attempting to filter any domains that conflict with an exception rule on the original list.

**Because these are automated, converted _subsets_ of the original lists, please do not report omissions from these converted files to the list originator.**

&nbsp;

# Usage:
These converted files can be used with various DNS and domain-blocking tools:

## Using with [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/):
1. Copy the link to the Pi-Hole format for the desired list (from the appropriate table below).
2. [Add the URL to your Pi-Hole's block lists (**Settings** > **Pi-Hole's Block Lists**).](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/Customising-Sources-for-Ad-Lists)

## Using with other tools:
The converted lists are provided in a "Raw Domain List" format that contains only domains, one per line. Many other tools / scripts can ingest this format to add them to your blocklist.
